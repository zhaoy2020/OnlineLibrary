    "The excessive use of chemical pesticides poses significant threats to the global environment, prompting an urgent need for strategies to reduce their application worldwide. Biological control has emerged as a highly effective alternative; however, the traditional screening of biocontrol strains remains a bottleneck due to its inefficiency. In this study, we present BiocontrolStrain, a deep learning-based algorithm designed to streamline the selection of biocontrol strains. By leveraging whole-genome information, BiocontrolStrain evaluates the biocontrol potential of candidate strains. Using this approach, over 300 highly effective Bacillus subtilis strains were identified, with greenhouse and field trials confirming an accuracy rate of 90%. Our AI-driven method for biocontrol strain selection provides a powerful tool for the development of biopesticides, offering a sustainable path to reduce chemical pesticide use and protect global ecological health."
