Subtilis GLB191 was used as the object to systematically study efficient genetic transformation and traceless genome editing methods, and by screening and identifying the receptor of c-di-GMP and exploring its specific mechanism of action, it was clarified that the c-di-GMP signaling pathway is important in B. The regulatory model in subtilis provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent study of biocontrol shapes. The main findings are as follows:"
